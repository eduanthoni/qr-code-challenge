The application was made in HTML 5 and CSS 3, concepts such as flexbox and font antialiased were used. Page width, fonts and colors were all taken from the challenge's style guide files, with the exception of the font color of the smaller paragraph, as it was very light and barely visible, and the spacing like margin and padding were all defined by me.

Developing this challenge was relatively 'easy' but I found it very fun and didactic because I was able to put into practice important concepts of HTML and CSS.
